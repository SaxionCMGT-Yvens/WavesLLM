RESN {"reasoning":Enemy Red is at (11, 13), 4 tiles away. Wave at (9, 7) is directly south of my position. Moving to (9, 7) would place me on the wave tile, but I can attack the wave now to potentially extend my range toward the enemy. However, the wave is ~V (pointing down), which extends southward. The enemy is northeast of the wave, so this won't help. Instead, I should move closer to the enemy to get into attack range. Moving to (10, 6) gets me 1 step closer and maintains flexibility for next turn's attack.]}
