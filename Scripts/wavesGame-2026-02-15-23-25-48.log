2026-02-16 00:25:48;[SYSTEM];No immediate attack is possible. The enemy is at (8,6) and I am at (10,12). My attack range is 2, offset is 1. The closest the enemy can be is 1 tile away, and the furthest is 2 tiles away. The enemy is 4 tiles away (Manhattan distance: |10-8| + |12-6| = 2 + 6 = 8). I need to move closer. Moving to (10,10) will put me 6 tiles away. Moving to (11,11) will put me 5 tiles away. Moving to (9,11) will put me 5 tiles away. Moving to (10,13) will put me 7 tiles away. Moving to (11,12) will put me 5 tiles away. Moving to (9,12) will put me 5 tiles away. The best move to get closer is to move towards the enemy. (10,10) is a safe move. From (10,10), the enemy at (8,6) is 6 tiles away. This is still too far. Let's re-evaluate. The enemy is at (8,6). I am at (10,12). The Manhattan distance is |10-8| + |12-6| = 2 + 6 = 8. My attack range is 2, offset is 1. This means I can attack targets at Manhattan distance 1 or 2. I need to reduce the distance significantly. The closest safe move that brings me closer is (10,11) which is a wave tile. This is risky. Let's look at safe moves. (10,10) is safe. From (10,10), the distance to (8,6) is |10-8| + |10-6| = 2 + 4 = 6. Still too far. (11,11) is safe. From (11,11), distance to (8,6) is |11-8| + |11-6| = 3 + 5 = 8. No change. (9,11) is safe. From (9,11), distance to (8,6) is |9-8| + |11-6| = 1 + 5 = 6. No change. (11,12) is safe. From (11,12), distance to (8,6) is |11-8| + |12-6| = 3 + 6 = 9. Worse. (9,12) is safe. From (9,12), distance to (8,6) is |9-8| + |12-6| = 1 + 6 = 7. Better. Let's try to get as close as possible. The closest safe move that reduces distance is (9,12). From (9,12), the distance to (8,6) is 7. I need to be within 3 tiles (2 range + 1 offset). I need to move 4 more tiles closer. The wave at (9,7) is ~V. The wave at (10,11) is ~^. If I move to (10,11), I am on a wave tile, which is risky. From (10,11), distance to (8,6) is |10-8| + |11-6| = 2 + 5 = 7. Still too far. The best strategy is to move towards the enemy to reduce the distance. The safest move that reduces distance is (9,12). From (9,12), the distance is 7. The next closest safe move is (10,10). From (10,10), the distance is 6. Let's choose (10,10) to get closer. From (10,10), the enemy is at (8,6). Distance is 6. No attack possible. I will move to (10,10) to get closer.
