2026-02-10 22:47:53;[SYSTEM];Move to (10,10) to get enemy at (10,13) within range 2 (distance 3 now, will be 3 after move? Wait, check: from (10,10) to (10,13) is distance 3, still out of range. Actually, from (10,9) to (10,13) is distance 4. Need to get closer. Better move to (10,11) is wave tile, risky. Move to (10,12) is safe and puts enemy at (10,13) at distance 1? No, offset 1 means cannot attack adjacent. Enemy at (10,13) from (10,12) is distance 1, invalid due to offset. Need distance exactly 2. From (10,12) to (10,13) is 1, invalid. From (10,11) to (10,13) is 2, valid, but (10,11) is wave tile. I can move to (10,11) (wave) and then attack enemy at (10,13) because range 2, offset 1, distance 2 is valid. But moving onto wave tile is risky? It's allowed, but wave may affect movement? It says path must not cross wave tile, but moving onto is allowed. However, wave tile (10,11) is ~^, may push me next turn. But I can attack this turn after moving. So move to (10,11), attack (10,13). That's the only way to attack enemy this turn.
