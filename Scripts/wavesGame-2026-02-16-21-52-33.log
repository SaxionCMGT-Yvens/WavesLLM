2026-02-16 21:56:42;[SYSTEM];I am at critical health (1 HP) with an enemy Green ship at (4,8) and a neutral target at (7,9). My immediate priority is to attack the neutral target at (7,9) which is within my attack range (Manhattan distance 2 from my position at (9,9), outside offset of 1). This will deal damage and potentially help weaken threats. I cannot safely move closer to the Green ship at (4,8) without exposing myself further. After attacking the target, I should reposition to maintain distance from the Green enemy.
